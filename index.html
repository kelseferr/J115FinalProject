                <h2> In the Words of Her Best Friend </h2>
                 <p> Ferrell's best friend, Liam Coyle says that if he had to describe Ferrell to someone who has never met her, he would say: "Okay, she's great, but she's a lot, so just give her a minute." 
                </p>
                <p>Coyle stated that he streams Ferrell's music regularly, saying "it's alwasy impressive to me the variety between a song like Guest House and Soup." He says her lyrics are "raw and surprsingly melodic."</p>
                <p> "She's a very talented lyricist with a good ear for what she wants her songs to sound like," continued Coyle. He said his favorite song of Ferrell's was Lonely Planet.</p>
                <p>Coyle is also familiar with Ferrell's stand up comedy routines, from watching videos of her sets. "It's like her music: brash, honest, and deeply personal," he describes. "A good artist I think knows their subject pretty well and Kelsey knows herself pretty damn well," Coyle concluded. </p>
